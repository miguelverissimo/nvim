# Miguel's neovim distribution (alpha)
Nvim configuration with sensible defaults

Main source of inspiration / copy is [Luan's nvim distribution](https://github.com/luan/nvim) as it was my first contact with a usable and pleasurable vim distro. I highly recommend you give it a try, as it leverages Luan's deep knowledge of (neo)vim and efficient workflows.
